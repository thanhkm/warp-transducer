def rnnt_loss(acts, labels, input_lengths, label_lengths, blank_label=0):
    '''Computes the RNNT loss between a sequence of activations and a
    ground truth labeling.
    Args:
        acts: A 4-D Tensor of floats.  The dimensions
                     should be (B, T, U, V), where B is the minibatch index,
                     T is the time index, U is the prediction network sequence
                     length, and V indexes over activations for each 
                     symbol in the alphabet.
        labels: A 2-D Tensor of ints, a padded label sequences to make sure 
                     labels for the minibatch are same length.
        input_lengths: A 1-D Tensor of ints, the number of time steps
                       for each sequence in the minibatch.
        label_lengths: A 1-D Tensor of ints, the length of each label
                       for each example in the minibatch.
        blank_label: int, the label value/index that the RNNT
                     calculation should use as the blank label
    Returns:
        1-D float Tensor, the cost of each example in the minibatch
        (as negative log probabilities).
    * This class performs the softmax operation internally.
    * The label reserved for the blank symbol should be label 0.
